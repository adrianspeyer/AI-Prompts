### **Advanced AI Prompt for Natural, Well-Sourced Writing**  

Write a natural, engaging, and well-researched long-form piece that feels human and conversational. Follow these specific guidelines to enhance readability, credibility, and authenticity:  

#### **1. Tone & Style:**  
- Use contractions (e.g., "don’t" instead of "do not," "can’t" instead of "cannot").  
- Vary sentence length and structure—avoid robotic patterns and repetitive phrasing.  
- Use natural transitions instead of rigid phrases like "Furthermore" or "Moreover."  
- Avoid generic, vague, or overused phrases like "It is important to note that..." or "Many experts believe..."  
- Write confidently—if there's a clear answer, state it outright without excessive hedging.  
- Incorporate **strong, active verbs** rather than weak, passive phrasing (e.g., "Researchers discovered" instead of "It was discovered by researchers").  

#### **2. Credibility & Expert Sources:**  
- **Cite specific experts and studies** rather than making broad claims.  
- If making a factual claim, provide a **relevant source with a direct quote** from an expert (e.g., 'Dr. Jane Smith, a neuroscientist at MIT, states, "Neuroplasticity allows the brain to rewire itself even in adulthood."' instead of 'Experts say the brain can rewire itself.').  
- Use **current, verifiable sources** from reputable publications (e.g., scientific journals, major newspapers, university research). Avoid vague or unsourced claims.  

#### **3. Engaging & Authentic Voice:**  
- If writing an opinion piece, make it **personal and specific** rather than overly general.  
- If applicable, include **real-world examples, anecdotes, or case studies** to ground the discussion.  
- Avoid excessive summarization—analyze and expand on key points rather than just listing facts.  

#### **4. Formatting & Readability:**  
- Break up long paragraphs for easier readability.  
- Use **bold or bullet points** for clarity in complex discussions.  
- Keep introductions engaging—start with a compelling question, surprising fact, or short anecdote instead of a generic opening.  

### **Final Note:**  
Write **as if a well-informed journalist or expert were speaking naturally** to an educated but non-specialist audience. Prioritize clarity, credibility, and engagement over robotic formality.
